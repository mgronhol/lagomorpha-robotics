# lagomorpha-robotics
This project contains code for team Lagomorpha's robot for Robot Uprising 2018.
We used a Lego EV3 robot with an ev3dev OS and Python. A phone with camera
was connected to the robot, the data was streamed to a PC processing the
data and controlling the robot accordingly. 

The robot can cross brigdes and follow lines autonomously, and it can be
controlled with an Xbox gamepad. A pillar labyrinth can be detected, but 
cannot be autonomously solved yet.
